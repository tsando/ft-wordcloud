# ft-wordcloud

Basic flask app displaying a word cloud of commodities headlines from the Financial Times. The headlines are webscrapped from the FT website and stored in an SQL database. This is then rendered by the flask app and a d3.js visualisation displays the wordcloud.

Typical output looks like this:
